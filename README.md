# AppLauncher2
Created: 09/14/2011

This is an upgraded version of my previous AppLauncher. This version saves and loads it's settings from an xml
file. This eliminates the need to have elevated rights on windows machines in order to run the application.
I have fixed a bug that caused the progress bar to not reset to 0 when the start button is pressed. I have also
added a working directory field to the add, edit, and insert dialogs as there are programs that require it be set.
I have also added a command line option that will cause the program to automatically start launching programs
when the program loads. To do this, just start the program with either /autostart or /a on the command line.
